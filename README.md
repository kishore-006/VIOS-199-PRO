Spam Email Detection Flask App

This is a Flask web application that uses a machine learning model to detect whether an email is spam or not. The app takes in an email message as input, and returns a prediction of whether the email is spam or not.

Project Summary


The Spam Email Detection Flask App is a machine learning project that aims to help users identify whether an email is spam or not. The app uses a machine learning model that has been trained on a dataset of labeled emails to predict whether an email is spam or not.

The project involves several steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and web application development. The machine learning model used in the app is a logistic regression model, which was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

The web application was developed using Flask, a popular web framework for Python. The app includes a simple HTML form that allows users to input an email message, which is then passed to the machine learning model for prediction. The app returns a prediction of whether the email is spam or not, along with a confidence score.

The project is an example of how machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems, such as spam email detection. The app can be useful for individuals and organizations who want to filter out unwanted or malicious emails from their inbox.
